# EntityFramework
Self study EF

This is a project I tried to follow from this tutorial http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/739164/Entity-Framework-Tutorial-for-Beginners
There is an issue with this project if you download from the tutorial and open it with VS2013. I guess that it is because the Entity Data Model of VS2013 is different from that of earlier versions.
And in the Entity Data Model Mapping step, I need to adjust the mapping of the entity's function and the corresponding Store Procedure.
